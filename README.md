# Arduino Serial Keyboard
This repository contains the arduino part of a keyboard emulator. Changes in switch-states are sent over the serial interface. 
On second thought, the solution here might not be the best. If I had to re-do it, I probably would have just sent over the changes, instead of all the button states.

## Why
This was made as part of a custom-built arcade cabinet.
